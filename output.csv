"complicated 3D character models are widely used in fields of entertainment, virtual reality, medicine etc",background_claim
The range of breathtaking realistic 3D models is only limited by the creativity of artists and resolution of devices,background_claim
a production cannot afford major revisions,background_claim
providing a flexible and efficient solution to animation remains an open problem,own_claim
Skeleton Subspace Deformation (SSD) is the predominant approach to character skinning at present,background_claim
Driving 3D models in a natural and believable manner is not trivial,background_claim
its ease of implementation,data
low cost of computing,data
"SSD is widely used in games, virtual reality and other realtime applications",background_claim
artists will edit the geometry of characters in the rest pose to fine-tune animations,background_claim
This approach is not commonly applied,background_claim
editing in the rest pose will influence most other poses,background_claim
SSD is also notorious for artifacts at rotating elbows and extreme poses,background_claim
Example based skinning methods such as Pose Space Deformation (PSD) are candidates for correcting SSD limitations,background_claim
PSD may be used as a compensation to the underlying SSD,background_claim
the animator specifies the PSD examples after the SSD has been performed,background_claim
"the examples are best interpolated in the rest pose, before the SSD has been applied",background_claim
the action of the SSD and any other deformations must be “inverted” in order to push the example compensation before these operations,background_claim
SSD is the most representative in the family of basic skinning,background_claim
this inverse strategy has a better performance than the same framework without it,own_claim
this approach will improve the quality of deformation,own_claim
they are seldom applied to interactive applications,background_claim
the high cost of computing,data
complicated algorithms,data
this category can generate more believable animation effects compared to its geometric counterpart,background_claim
Pose Space Deformation,background_claim
combines shape blending and Skeleton Subspace Deformation by formulating a scattered data interpolation problem over sculpted (or otherwise obtained) example poses,background_claim
[ 1 ],data
Related research efforts have improved the speed and power of example-based skinning,background_claim
incorporate linear elements into RBF to produce constant changes between examples,background_claim
[ 2 ],data
precompute principal components of the deformation influences for individual kinematic joints instead of storing displacements for key poses,background_claim
enabling realtime rendering large nonlinear finite element models of human hands,background_claim

introduce weighted pose space deformation for deforming realistic models of human hand,background_claim
[ 4 ],data
these example-based approaches can be considered as non-parametric skin deformation methods,background_claim
identifies statistically relevant bones and approximates bone transforms from example mesh animations,background_claim
[ 5 ],data
these have also seen some development in recent years,background_claim

are also common practices in the entertainment production,background_claim

the inverse operation can improve the results,own_claim
inverse operation is required,own_claim
SSD is widely applied to interactive applications such as games and virtual reality,background_claim
it is implemented in most commercial animation packages,background_claim
its simplicity,data
efficiency,data
SSD is very popular in circumstances that require animating a number of characters in real time,background_claim
vertex transformations can be easily implemented in the graphic card,data
the domain of adjusting one vertex in this way is strictly limited to the linear subspace formed by the vertex as transformed by joints influencing this vertex,background_claim
"When a character goes wrong in some pose, animators can adjust joint influence weights",background_claim
SSD cannot synthesize many parts of a character skin involving complicated joint structures,background_claim
deforming is limited to a linear subspace,background_claim
[ 1 ],data
a combination of SSD and shape blending providing nice solution to above mentioned problems,background_claim
[ 1 ],data
PSD and improved example-based schemes have been discussed in many publications,background_claim
[ 2 ],data
[ 3 ],data
[ 4 ],data
the reason why the inverse should be performed is still ambiguous,own_claim
inverting the SSD (and other deformations) in order to interpolate the examples in the rest pose is a the right choice,own_claim
it is an improvement,own_claim
the superiority of the inverse method,own_claim
